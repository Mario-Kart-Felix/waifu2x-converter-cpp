# waifu2x (converter only version)

This is a reimplementation of waifu2x ([original](https://github.com/nagadomi/waifu2x)) converter function, in C++, using OpenCV.
This is also a reimplementation of [waifu2x python version](https://marcan.st/transf/waifu2x.py) by [Hector Martin](https://marcan.st/blog/).
You can use this as command-line tool of image noise reduction or/and scaling.


## Prebuilt binary-form release

Please see [releases](https://github.com/WL-Amigo/waifu2x-converter-cpp/releases) of this repository.
There is only for-windows binary, now. Sorry.

### works using waifu2x-converter

 * [waifu2x_win_koroshell](http://inatsuka.com/extra/koroshell/)
   - waifu2x-converter GUI frontend that is easy to use, and so cute. You need only drag&drop to convert your image. (and also you can set converting mode, noise reduction level, scale ratio, etc..., on GUI)
   - Both waifu2x-converter x86 and x64 are included this package, and GUI see your windows architecture(x86|x64) and selects automatically which to use. 
   - For windows only.


## Dependencies

### Platform

 * Ubuntu
 * Mac OS X?
 * Windows
 
(This program probably can be built under MacOSX, because OpenCV and other libraries support OS X)

### Libraries

 * [OpenCV](http://opencv.org/)(C++, version 3.0.0 rc1)

This programs also depends on libraries shown below, but these are already included in this repository.
*CUDA Support in OpenCV is optional, since not required. (in version 1.0.0, CUDA Support is not used.)*

 * [picojson](https://github.com/kazuho/picojson)
 * [TCLAP(Templatized C++ Command Line Parser Library)](http://tclap.sourceforge.net/)

## How to build

### for Ubuntu

Sorry, under construction...

These are hints for building :

 * I recommend to install OpenCV from sources. (build instruction is found [here](http://opencv.org/quickstart.html))
 * include path : `include/` `(/path/to/opencv/installed/directory)/include`
 * library path : `(/path/to/opencv/installed/directory)/lib` 
     - if you have built and installed OpenCV from source, and have changed install directory(by using `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX`), you may need to set environment variable `LD_LIBRARY_PATH` for your OpenCV installed directory.
 * libraries to link : `opencv_core` `opencv_imgproc` `opencv_imgcodecs` `opencv_features2d`
 * standard of C++ : `c++11`



## Usage

Usage of this program can be seen by executing this with `--help` option.

typescript-action status

Create a JavaScript Action using TypeScript
Use this template to bootstrap the creation of a TypeScript action.üöÄ

This template includes compilation support, tests, a validation workflow, publishing, and versioning guidance.

If you are new, there's also a simpler introduction. See the Hello World JavaScript Action

Create an action from this template
Click the Use this Template and provide the new repo details for your action

Code in Main
Install the dependencies

$ npm install
Build the typescript and package it for distribution

$ npm run build && npm run package
Run the tests ‚úîÔ∏è

$ npm test

 PASS  ./index.test.js
  ‚úì throws invalid number (3ms)
  ‚úì wait 500 ms (504ms)
  ‚úì test runs (95ms)

...
Change action.yml
The action.yml contains defines the inputs and output for your action.

Update the action.yml with your name, description, inputs and outputs for your action.

See the documentation

Change the Code
Most toolkit and CI/CD operations involve async operations so the action is run in an async function.

import * as core from '@actions/core';
...

async function run() {
  try { 
      ...
  } 
  catch (error) {
    core.setFailed(error.message);
  }
}

run()
See the toolkit documentation for the various packages.

Publish to a distribution branch
Actions are run from GitHub repos so we will checkin the packed dist folder.

Then run ncc and push the results:

$ npm run package
$ git add dist
$ git commit -a -m "prod dependencies"
$ git push origin releases/v1
Note: We recommend using the --license option for ncc, which will create a license file for all of the production node modules used in your project.

Your action is now published! üöÄ

See the versioning documentation

Validate
You can now validate the action by referencing ./ in a workflow in your repo (see test.yml)

uses: ./
with:
  milliseconds: 1000
See the actions tab for runs of this action! üöÄ

Usage:
After testing you can create a v1 tag to reference the stable and latest V1 action
