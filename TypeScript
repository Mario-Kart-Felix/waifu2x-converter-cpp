Open command prompt (cmd.exe/git bash)

Recommended:

npm install -g typescript@latest
or

yarn global add typescript@latest  // if you use yarn package manager
This will install the latest typescript version if not already installed, otherwise it will update the current installation to the latest version.

And then verify which version is installed:

tsc -v
enter image description here

If you have typescript already installed you could also use the following command to update to latest version, but as commentators have reported and I confirm it that the following command does not update to latest (as of now [ Feb 10 '17])!

npm update -g typescript@latest
